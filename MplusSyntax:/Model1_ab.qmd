On this page, we present the Mplus model syntax used to specify saturated network models of process features, as introduced in Andresen et. al. (in prep). This syntax corresponds with models 1a and 1b, as presented in section 3.3.1 of the paper.

Please use the tabs below to navigate between syntax of model 1a (excluding random residual variance), and syntax of model 1b (including random residual variance).

## Saturated Network Model 1a

The syntax for specifying Model 1a is given below.

``` default
TITLE:      M1a: Network of Mean and Inertia/Autoregression

DATA:
            FILE = "EXAMPLE.dat";

VARIABLE:
  
            NAMES = ID hour Y1 Y2 Y3;
            MISSING=.;

            CLUSTER = ID;
            
            USEVAR = Y1 Y2 Y3 ;
            LAGGED = Y1(1) Y2(1) Y3(1);
            
            TINTERVAL = hour(1);
            MISSING = ALL(999);
            
ANALYSIS:

            TYPE = TWOLEVEL RANDOM;
            ESTIMATOR = BAYES;
            BITERATIONS = (10000);
            CHAINS=2;
            PROCESSORS = 30;
            
MODEL:

## Saturated Network Model 2b

The syntax for specifying Model 1b is given below.

``` default

            FILE = "EXAMPLE.dat";

            USEVAR = Y1 Y2 Y3 ;
            LAGGED = Y1(1) Y2(1) Y3(1);
            
            TINTERVAL = hour(1);
            MISSING = ALL(999);
            
ANALYSIS:

            TYPE = TWOLEVEL RANDOM;
