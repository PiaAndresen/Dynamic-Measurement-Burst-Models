    "text": "On this page, we present the Mplus model syntax used to specify the DMBM, as introduced in Andresen et. al. (in prep). This syntax corresponds with models 2a and 2b, as presented in section 3.3.2 of the paper.\n\nSpecifying the DMBM in four Steps\nWe can specify the DMBM in four steps.\n\nSpecify the within part, where we specify the micro-level model for each burst separately. Per burst, we specify autoregressive parameters phi1,  phi2, phi3,...; phiBurst. Optionally, we can additionally specify the random residual variances (rv1,rv2,rv3...;) per burst, which can then be further modeled as the log residual variance (i.e., the compound of reactivity and exposure to shocks) at the %BETWEEN% level.\nSpecify the between part, where the random intercepts are specified. It is specified using the BY command, RI_Y BY Y1@1 Y2@1 Y#@1...;, where @1 fixes the factor loading to one. This process is repeated for every process feature modeled at the meso- and macro-level. Furthermore, for each feature at each burst, we define the burst- and person-specific deviations from the person’s random intercept (i.e., the within-person components WC). For example, for the mean at burst 1, we write: WCY1 BY Y1; Y1@0.001; which defines the within-person component for the mean and fixes the prior for residual variance of the observed mean Y1 to (almost) zero.\nSpecify the meso-level dynamics between burst- and person-specific deviations from the person’s random intercept of that feature at each burst, using WCY2 WCY3 ON WCY1 WCY2; ..., to define autoregressive effects, and WCY2 WCY3 ON WCPHI1 WCPHI2; ... to define cross-lagged effects.\nSpecify relevant covariances and residual covariances at the meso-level. Here, we constrain residual covariances to be equal at all bursts (e.g., WCY2 WITH WCRV2 (rc1); WCY3 WITH WCRV3 (rc1);) to simplify the model.\n\nBelow, we present syntax for each of these steps, for models 2a (excl. random residual variances) and 2b (incl. random residual variances) presented in the paper. Please note that Mplus defaults vary in some places between the two models.\n\n\nStep 1: Specifying the WITHIN Level\n\n%WITHIN% Model 2a%WITHIN% Model 2b\n\n\nThe syntax for specifying the WITHIN part of the DMBM excluding random residual variances (i.e., model 2a) is given below.\nTITLE:    Mode2a DMBM;\nDATA:     FILE = \"Example.dat\";\n\nVARIABLE: NAMES = ID hour Y1 Y2 Y3;\n          MISSING=.;\n\n          CLUSTER = ID;\n          USEVAR = Y1 Y2 Y3 ;\n\n          LAGGED = Y1(1) Y2(1) Y3(1);\n\n          TINTERVAL = hour(1);\n          MISSING = ALL(999);\n\nANALYSIS:\n          TYPE = TWOLEVEL RANDOM;\n          ESTIMATOR = BAYES;\n          FBITERATIONS = (50000);\n          THIN = 10;\n          CHAINS=2;\n          PROCESSORS = 40;\n\nMODEL:\n\n%WITHIN%\n     \n!
